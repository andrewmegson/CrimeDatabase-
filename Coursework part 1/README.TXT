PROJECT TITLE: The Thin Blue Line Crime Reporting System

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This project simulates a database that can be used to enter the details of a crime incident;
- the value of good stolen, 
- postcode where it happened, 
- month in which it happened, 
- year in which it happened and
- the district in which it happened.

Once incidents have been entered into the system the user can then access statistics of the data by calling 3 methods;
- the district with the largest average value incident for a given year
- the largest value incident ever recorded
- a list of all incidents recorded with value greater than a given amount of money
